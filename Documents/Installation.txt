== Encore Installation Guide File ==

A simple build and installation of Encore requires only a few things to be installed
on your machine:

 * The latest supported version of the .NET Framework (see Compatibility.txt)
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (Express should work; Professional and above
   preferred)

If you are on Linux, you need the following installed:

 * The latest supported version of the Mono runtime/framework (see
   Compatibility.txt)
 * Mono's MCS C# compiler (with support for the installed runtime)
 * Mono's XBuild tool (with support for the installed runtime)

To build and install on Windows, simply fire up Visual Studio, open the Encore
solution file (Trinity.Encore.sln), and trigger a build (Build -> Build Solution).
You may choose to build in either Debug or Release mode. Debug mode will include
useful debugging information (such as logging), and will trigger the code analyzer,
as well as the Code Contracts tools (if you have these installed). A Release build
will simply build the source.

On Linux, simply run either MonoDebug.sh or MonoRelease.sh. These will trigger a
build for the respective mode, using the system's installed XBuild and MCS.

The compiled files can be found in the /bin directory.
