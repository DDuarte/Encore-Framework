== Encore Installation Guide File ==

A simple build and installation of Encore requires only a few things to be installed
on your machine:

 * The latest supported version of the .NET Framework (see Compatibility.txt)
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (Express should work; Professional and above
   preferred)

If you are on Linux, you need the following installed:

 * The latest supported version of the Mono runtime/framework (see
   Compatibility.txt)
 * Mono's MCS C# compiler (with support for the installed runtime)
 * Mono's XBuild tool (with support for the installed runtime)

To build and install on Windows, simply fire up Visual Studio, open the Encore
solution file (Trinity.Encore.sln), and trigger a build (Build -> Build Solution).
Alternatively, you can run "MSBuild Trinity.Encore.sln" to build the solution
without using Visual Studio. This can be useful if you don't have access to a
commercial version.

On Linux, simply run either MonoDebug.sh or MonoRelease.sh. These will trigger a
build for the respective mode, using the system's installed XBuild and MCS.

Debug mode will include useful debugging information (such as logging), and will
trigger the code analyzer, as well as the Code Contracts tools (if you have these
installed). A Release build will simply build the source, and does not include
contract assertions.

Note that Debug on Windows will only work if you have Code Contracts installed. This
is not the case with Mono, as the methods on the Contract class don't throw there.

The compiled files can be found in the /bin directory.
