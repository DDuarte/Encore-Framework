== Encore Code Documentation File ==

Documentation for the Encore source base can easily be built, provided that the Mono
documentation tools are installed on your system (Monodoc, monodocer, mdoc). If you
are on Windows, you will also need Cygwin, as the scripts to build the documentation
are written in Bash.

To build the documentation, open your system shell, and switch to the /Documentation
directory. Then, execute:

  ./MakeDocs.sh

This builds the full documentation package, which includes Monodoc-style XML files
and generated HTML documentation in both the light and dark styles.

If you wish to build documentation only for a specific style, or for a specific
build mode (MakeDocs.sh defaults to Debug), then you must use MonoDoc.sh. It has two
parameters:

 * --style=<STYLE_FILE>
 * --mode=<BUILD_MODE>

STYLE_FILE can be any XSLT file that specifies the style to use for the generated
HTML documentation. It must follow the Monodoc template. Encore comes with two
styles: Style.Dark.xsl and Style.Light.xsl. The default is to use Style.Light.xsl.

BUILD_MODE must be either Debug or Release. Note that the Encore solution normally
doesn't generate XML documentation files in Release. The default is Debug.

Example:

  ./MonoDoc.sh --style=Style.Dark.xsl --mode=Release
