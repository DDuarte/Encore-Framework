== Encore Introduction File ==

Welcome to Encore.

Encore is a scalable server architecture aiming at emulating the World of Warcraft
game servers. It uses an actor-based threading model, and focuses on separating
logic into services that can be distributed and cooperate across machines. An
abstract SQL layer is used for databasing (supporting most SQL servers) with support
for migrations and automatic schema updates. Configurationis done via standard .NET
XML configuration.

Encore consists of two components: The abstract and fully reusable framework and the
World of Warcraft game server implementation. The Encore framework has deliberately
been designed to be reused for other server implementations, so that others can save
great amounts of development time by not having to write the typical foundational
code for a server application. Given Encore's licensing (see License.txt), this
framework can even be used in commercial/proprietary applications.

The source is written in pure C# code, using the Common Language Runtime and the
.NET Framework. We put great effort into avoiding any unportable code, such as
P/Invoke, and thus support both the Microsoft and Mono runtimes.

The codebase focuses on design-by-contract (both with static analysis and runtime
checking), as well as unit testing and related techniques, to ensure program
correctness.
